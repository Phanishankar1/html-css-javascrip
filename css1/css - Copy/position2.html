<p>When you want to design complex layouts, you'll need to change the typical document flow and override the default browser styles.

You have to control how elements behave and are positioned on the page.

For example, you may want to stack elements next to each other or on top of one another in a specific way or make a header "stick" to the top of the page and not move when you scroll up and down the page.

To do the above, and much more, you'll use CSS's position property.

This property takes in five values: static, relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky.

In this article, we'll focus on the relative and absolute values.

We'll see an overview of how they work, their differences from one another, and how they are best used in conjunction for maximum effect.

Let's get started!
